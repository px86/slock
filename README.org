#+TITLE: slock - simple screen locker by suckless.org

simple screen locker utility for X.

* Requirements

In order to build slock you need the Xlib header files.

* Installation

Edit =config.mk= to match your local setup (=slock= is installed into
the =/usr/local= namespace by default).

Edit =config.h= to update your username and groupname.

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

#+begin_src shell
  make clean install
#+end_src

* Running slock

Simply invoke the =slock= command. To get out of it, enter your password.
* Message patch

The lock screen display a message. A default message can be defined in =config.h=, moreover, the message can also be passed using the =-m= command line option.

For example,

#+begin_src shell
  slock -m "Locked at $(date)"
#+end_src

Note: the =font_name= variable in =config.h= must be set to a valid X11 font. To get a list of X11 fonts, run =slock -f=.
